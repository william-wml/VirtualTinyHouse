# VirtualTinyHouse

This project seeks to design a virtual tiny house on wheels with blender (a free and open-source 3D computer graphics software). The intent is to support characteristics of kinesthetic learning largely within one file for users that are interested in building their very own tiny house - a real asset.

# Overview

Note: this repo is presently structured to help keep track of drafts - truly a work in progress.
